Method implemented and tested

Volatile modifier guarantees that any thread that reads a field will see the most recently written value
Transient allow you to define variables that you don't want to serialize.

Result of code execution is:
	Waiting for b to complete...
	Total is: 0
	
For changed variant will be:
	Waiting for b to complete...
	Total is: 100
	
First variant actually is not waiting thread b, because Java not garantee that execution of separate thread will be finished when you just pause your code in main thread. 
You should implement wait mechanism like in second variant.
